# CSES-Solutions

These are solutions for [CSES Problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset) in C++.

You can find the solutions for each problem in the corresponding folder for its topic. Refer to each folder's README to locate the solution for a particular problem for each topic.

The solution file for each problem is named after the problem, and each solution file is well documented and commented.

## Behind the scenes

The ```scripts``` folder contains python program to update the README files for each topic folder. The program is run using GitHub Actions, and the README files are updated automatically whenever a new solution is added. Another json file is also updated to keep track of questions in the problemset.
